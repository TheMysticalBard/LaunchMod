# LaunchMod
A simple Minecraft mod that adds one enchantment to the game, the Launch enchantment. It lets players that have it on their boots jump 2 blocks high as well as hold shift to charge up super jumps based on the enchantment's level.

If anyone has suggestions for code style or anything, let me know. This is my first MC mod and I have no idea what conventions are. Thanks!
